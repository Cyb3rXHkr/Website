      <h2>Intro</h2>
      <p><strong>Welcome to the Edge of Cyberspace</strong></p>
      <p>
        You’ve just accessed the digital domain of a cybersecurity enthusiast and ethical hacker passionate about exploring the hidden layers of the internet, exposing vulnerabilities, and building digital fortresses.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here, curiosity meets code. Defense is crafted with precision. And every exploit is an opportunity to learn.
      </p>
      <p>
        Trace the signal. Break the system. Strengthen the future.
      </p>

    <div id="work" class="section">
      <h2>My Work</h2>
      <p>
        My work is rooted in curiosity, precision, and ethical responsibility. I specialize in discovering system weaknesses before the adversaries do — turning potential threats into hardened defenses.
      </p>
      <p>I engage in projects involving:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Penetration Testing: Simulating real-world attacks to identify and exploit vulnerabilities.</li>
        <li>Vulnerability Research: Deep analysis of systems, protocols, and applications to uncover flaws.</li>
        <li>Security Audits: Full-stack assessments of infrastructure, from networks to web applications.</li>
        <li>Threat Modeling & Defense: Designing strategies to prevent, detect, and mitigate cyber threats.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Whether it's freelance consulting, collaboration on open-source security tools, or private research, I bring technical expertise and a hacker mindset to every mission.
      </p>
      <p><strong>If it's broken — I’ll find it. If it can be secured, I’ll help build it.</strong></p>
    </div>

    <div id="about" class="section">

      <p><strong>Cybersecurity Enthusiast & Ethical Hacker</strong></p>
      <p>
        I’m a cybersecurity enthusiast driven by a passion for exploring, learning, and securing the digital systems that shape our world. I work as a security researcher, focusing on vulnerability assessment, penetration testing, and cyber defense strategies.
      </p>
      <p>
        With a technical and ethical mindset, I investigate weaknesses, simulate real-world attacks, and develop solutions to strengthen digital environments. I believe security starts with knowledge, and I’m constantly evolving to keep up with threats that never stand still.
      </p>
      <p><em>“To beat a hacker, you need to think like one.”</em></p>
